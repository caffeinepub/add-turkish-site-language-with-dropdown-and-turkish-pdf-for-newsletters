  "summary": "Implemented an English/Turkish dropdown and added a translations module used across Header/Newsletter UI, plus language-based PDF URL switching for Newsletter 1. However, the diff appears to introduce extra language scaffolding, modifies an immutable file, adds a PDF.js CDN dependency, and does not show the Turkish PDF asset being added. Some user-facing strings (e.g., footer) remain untranslated.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Implement Turkish translations for all user-facing text currently hardcoded in the UI so that switching the language to Turkish renders Turkish text throughout the site.",
      "reason": "The footer text remains in English and is not sourced via the translation system, so it will not switch to Turkish.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "When Turkish is selected, Newsletter 1 must open the attached Turkish PDF asset instead of the English PDF.",
      "reason": "Code references a Turkish PDF path, but the diff does not show the Turkish PDF file being added to the repository/assets, so the required attached asset integration is not evidenced.",

      "description": "Introduced loading PDF.js from a third-party CDN inside the PDF viewer to detect page count.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest non-goals disallow adding third-party translation services/external APIs and also ask not to redesign PDF viewer behavior beyond selecting the correct PDF per language; adding a CDN-loaded dependency and new PDF processing logic is not requested and changes viewer behavior.",
